Download manga pages from [comic-walker.com](https://comic-walker.com/)

Still trying to figure out the loading limits, as when I don't flip through enough pages or when I scroll too far the downloaded images become empty (as in, entirely transparent). Unlike comic days and shonen jump plus they don't have a JSON file with all the image src links. Too lazy to write an extended description
